Greetings otherworlders!

My name is Sabir. I am a 37 year old freelance developer entering the game late. Better late than never, tech is on the rise and
with that, demand for developers will increase and I.. I need a job. So, this seems like a good idea.

A little bit more about me:

I began coding back in somewhere around '92 or '93 because I changed a variable in the GORILLAS.BAS file that came with QBASIC in every copy of Windows 3.1 and beyond. This simple change caused an exploding banana to destory an entire city in one fell swoop. My angsty, 10 year old appetite for destruction was insatiably satisfied. From that point, I self-taught myself QBASIC, PASCAL, C / C++, light assembly and eventually Visual Basic with heavy focus on utilizing Windows API functions. I took a long break and re-entered the scene with heavy interest in graphic design, adding Adobe Creative Suite, HTML and CSS into my repertoire. Another break and then I returned again to catch up my skills, this time with a focus on HTML5, CSS3, Java and Visual C++. One final break, the world went crazy and now I'm back going through self-imposed boot camp learning JSES2020 eagerly and awaiting to learn more! 

I'm. Hungry!
