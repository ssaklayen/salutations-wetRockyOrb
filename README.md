Hello! My name is Sabir Saklayen. I am a semi-self taught web and software developer. I am currently working through a full-stack web dev course on Udemy with a focus on Node.js. I have completed a 96-hour JavaScript course through Udemy as well. In addition to updating my skillset via online courses, I have completed 2 years of university, majoring in Computer Science with a prime focus on Java and database administration. I have received a certificate of completion for these courses but I am shy of one internship to complete my Associate's degree. Beyond all this... I just love coding. I like to solve problems. I can be patient throughout the coding frustrations of "WTF? This was JUST working??!" I love the "AHAA!" moments. That dopamine rush is unparalleled. Coding is such a simple yet satisfying joy and I am very excited to be part of the community!
